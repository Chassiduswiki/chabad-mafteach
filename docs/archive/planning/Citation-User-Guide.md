# Citation System User Guide

## Overview

The Chabad Mafteach citation system has been enhanced to automatically connect quotes and sources with books in your library. When you create citations, the system intelligently searches your document collection first, then provides Sefaria integration for external sources.

## How It Works

### Smart Citation Creation

When you create a citation, the system follows this intelligent workflow:

1. **Local Library First**: Searches your document collection for matching books
2. **Existing Sources**: Shows previously created sources
3. **External Discovery**: Offers Sefaria search for texts not in your library

## Using the Citation System

### Creating a Citation

1. **Open the Editor**: Navigate to any topic or document in edit mode
2. **Add Citation**: Click the citation button or use the keyboard shortcut
3. **Search**: Start typing the name of the book or source

### Understanding Search Results

The citation palette shows results with visual indicators:

#### 🟢 **Green Badge - Documents in Your Library**
These are books already in your Chabad Mafteach library. Selecting one creates a citation directly linked to that document.

```
🟢 Tanya (Likkutei Amarim) - Ch. 1
   "Found this book in your library - cite it directly?"
```

#### 🔵 **Blue Badge - Existing Sources**
These are sources you've cited before. They may or may not be linked to documents.

```
🔵 Likkutei Sichos, Vol. 1 - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson
   "Previously cited source"
```

#### 🟣 **Purple Option - Search Sefaria**
When no local matches are found, this option appears to search external Jewish texts.

```
🟣 Search Sefaria
   "Can't find it locally? Search Sefaria for external sources"
```

## Step-by-Step Citation Creation

### Method 1: Document in Your Library

1. Type the book name (e.g., "Tanya", "Likkutei Sichos")
2. Select the green-badged result from your library
3. The system automatically associates the citation with that document
4. Add your reference (chapter, page, etc.)
5. Citation is created and linked to the source document

### Method 2: Existing Source

1. Type part of a source you've used before
2. Select the blue-badged existing source
3. Update the reference if needed
4. Citation uses the existing source relationship

### Method 3: External Source (Sefaria)

1. Type a book name not in your library
2. If no local matches, click "Search Sefaria"
3. Browse Sefaria results with live preview
4. Select the desired text
5. The system imports it as an external source
6. Citation is created with Sefaria linkage

## Citation Benefits

### 🔗 **Document Linking**
Citations are now connected to actual documents in your library, providing:
- Direct navigation to source material
- Better research context
- Prevention of duplicate sources for the same book

### 🔍 **Unified Search**
One search interface finds everything:
- Books in your Chabad Mafteach library
- Previously cited sources
- External Jewish texts via Sefaria

### 📚 **Research Enhancement**
- No more guessing if a book is "already in the system"
- Automatic suggestions: "Found this book in your library!"
- Seamless external source discovery

## Advanced Features

### Fuzzy Search
The system uses intelligent fuzzy matching:
- "Tanya" finds "Likkutei Amarim"
- "Likutei Sichos" finds "Likkutei Sichos"
- Partial matches work across titles and authors

### Sefaria Integration
When searching external sources:
- Live preview of Hebrew and English text
- Direct links to full Sefaria pages
- Proper citation formatting
- Metadata preservation

### Smart Deduplication
The system prevents duplicate sources by:
- Matching against existing document titles
- Fuzzy author name matching
- Confidence scoring for automatic associations

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find a Book I Know Is There
- Try alternative spellings or abbreviations
- Check if the document is published (drafts aren't searchable)
- Contact admin if it's a data issue

### Sefaria Search Not Working
- Check internet connection
- Ensure the text exists on Sefaria
- Try different search terms

### Citation Not Linking to Document
- Verify the document exists and is published
- Check if the title matches exactly
- The system will show association confidence

## Best Practices

### Citation Creation
1. **Use Full Book Names**: "Likkutei Sichos" instead of just "Sichos"
2. **Check Green Results First**: Documents in your library are prioritized
3. **Verify References**: Always double-check chapter/page numbers
4. **Use Sefaria for External**: When citing texts not in your collection

### Source Management
1. **One Source Per Book**: Let the system handle deduplication
2. **Complete Metadata**: Fill in author, title, and reference details
3. **Link When Possible**: Prefer library documents over external sources

## Examples

### Example 1: Citing Tanya
```
Search: "Tanya"
Result: 🟢 Tanya (Likkutei Amarim) - Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi
Action: Click to select
Result: Citation linked to Tanya document in library
```

### Example 2: New External Source
```
Search: "Mishneh Torah"
Result: No local matches
Action: Click "Search Sefaria"
Result: Browse and select from Sefaria results
Final: Citation with external Sefaria linkage
```

### Example 3: Existing Source
```
Search: "Hayom Yom"
Result: 🔵 Hayom Yom - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson
Action: Click to reuse existing source
Result: Citation using previous source relationship
```
