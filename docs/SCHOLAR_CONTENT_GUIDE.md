### 2. Core Content (Standard)

**Short Description (1-3 sentences):**
```
The nefesh is the lowest level of the soul, corresponding to the basic life-force found in all living things, including animals. It encompasses natural instincts and vital functions but lacks the higher spiritual capacities unique to humans.
```

**Detailed Overview (1-3 paragraphs):**
```
The concept of nefesh in Chabad philosophy represents the most fundamental level of spiritual life. Unlike the higher levels of the soul (ruach, neshamah, chaya, yechidah), the nefesh is primarily concerned with sustaining physical life and natural behaviors. In the Tanya, the Alter Rebbe explains that the nefesh manifests through natural character traits and instincts that can be refined and elevated through divine service.

This lowest level of soul serves as the foundation for all spiritual growth. While it operates primarily in the realm of the natural and instinctual, the nefesh contains the potential for transformation when properly directed. Through the practice of avodah (spiritual service), even these basic life-forces can be elevated to serve holy purposes, bridging the gap between the mundane and the sacred.
```

## Teaching Aids (Optional but Recommended)

### Parable (Mashal)
```
The nefesh is like the engine of a car - it provides the basic power that makes everything run. While the engine itself isn't the destination or the driver, without it, the car can't move at all. Through proper maintenance and fuel (spiritual service), even this basic mechanism can be refined to run smoothly and efficiently.
```

### Universal Application (Global Nimshal)
```
Just as every living thing needs a basic life-force, every spiritual journey needs a foundation. We must start with where we are, with our basic nature and tendencies, and build from there rather than trying to skip the essential groundwork.
```

### Charts and Tables

5. Yechidah - Absolute unity (extremely rare)
