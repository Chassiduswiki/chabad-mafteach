## 🎯 **Next Session Prompt**

**For starting Phase 4:**

```
I want to implement Phase 4: Community & Collections for the Chabad Research wiki. This phase focuses on transforming the platform from a single-author resource into a collaborative community platform where users can save, organize, and engage with content collectively.

## Current Status
We've completed Phase 3 with:
- ✅ AI-Powered Search (#6) - Smart search with relevance scoring
- ✅ Edit Button on Fields (#8) - Quick editor access  
- ✅ User Feedback System (#9) - Mobile-friendly content quality feedback
- ⚠️ TipTap Editor Enhancement (#5) - Blocked by TypeScript issues

## Phase 4 Goals
1. **Public User Collections** - Users can save and organize topics into collections
2. **User Collections Pages** - Beautiful collection UI with rich previews
3. **Collaborative Annotations** - Community notes and discussions on content

## Available Infrastructure
- ✅ Admin Dashboard - Mobile-optimized analytics dashboard
- ✅ User Authentication - Secure user system
- ✅ Topic Management - Content creation and editing
- ✅ Feedback System - Content quality tracking
- ✅ Mobile-First Components - Responsive UI foundation

## Key Requirements
- **Mobile-First Design** - All features must work seamlessly on mobile
- **Social Features** - Sharing, following, community engagement
- **Content Organization** - Collections, tagging, categorization
- **Collaboration Tools** - Comments, discussions, version history
- **Performance** - Efficient data loading and caching

## Technical Considerations
- Database schema for collections and user relationships
- API endpoints for collection management
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Mobile optimization for all UI components
- Social sharing capabilities
- Permission systems for public/private content

## Questions to Address
1. What should the collection data structure look like?
2. How should public vs private collections work?
3. What collaboration features are most important for a Chabad wiki?
4. How should we handle content versioning in collections?
5. What social features would be most valuable?

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with database schema for collections
2. Build collection management UI (mobile-first)
3. Implement public collection discovery
4. Add collaborative annotation system
5. Create social sharing and engagement features
