So too, at first we cultivate and reveal the hidden potential of our neshamah (our nefesh elokis); yet, our body (and nefesh habehamis) remains the same and desires physical things. For example, at first we develop good manners (derech eretz) so that we don’t act like an animal. Then, we use our bodies and talents to serve Hashem through Torah and mitzvos. When we are involved in holy things, our Neshamah shines and we are inspired, but later when we go back to our physical life, we still desire the same physical pleasures.\nThe second step is like a tanner, who transforms raw hides into beautiful leathers. So too, we transform the nature of our body (and our nefesh habehamis and yetzer hara). When we work very hard to serve Hashem, and have self-sacrifice (mesiras nefesh) for Torah and mitzvos—especially for helping others (tzedakah and ahavas yisrael)—this transforms our nature, so that even our body and animal soul want to serve Hashem."

Just as a baby can only eat milk, but an adult needs bread and meat, so it is with the soul’s food. A child’s belief in G-d is proper by imagining G-d as a big, strong man, with powerful arms, something like his father, but even stronger. But for an adult, such an idea contradicts the basic principle of our faith, that G-d is neither a body, nor a form in a body, and so forth. As we grow, we must “update the files” to match our new maturity and ability.\nOur sages and Rebbeim have prepared for us the finest of delicacies.

To make the child understand, the teacher must put aside his understanding and values. Only then can the teacher enter the child’s world and present the idea in terms that the child can relate to—that learning is good because you will earn candy.\nYet, although the child is too immature to appreciate it now, he is really tasting the enjoyment of learning for its own sake. As he grows he will become refined enough to appreciate how his teacher helped him cultivate his innate curiosity. He will then realize that the teacher’s there all along—he always loved to learn and grow for its own sake—it was just that this part of himself was hidden from his childish view."
