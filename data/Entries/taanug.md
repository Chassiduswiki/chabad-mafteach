# Taanug (תענוג) - Divine Pleasure

---

## Definition

**Taanug** (Heb. תענוג) means "Pleasure" or "Delight." In Chassidus, it is the deepest source of Will — you want something because it brings you pleasure. At the Divine level, Taanug is associated with *Atik Yomin* (the innermost aspect of Keter) and represents G-d's essential delight in creation and in the Jewish soul's service.

**Hebrew**: תענוג  
**Root**: ע-נ-ג (Ayin-Nun-Gimel) — to delight, take pleasure  
**Sefirah**: Inner Keter (*Atik Yomin*)  
**Pronunciation**: tah-ah-NOOG

## Overview

### The Core Concept

The hierarchy of the soul:
1. **Taanug** — Pleasure (deepest)
2. **Ratzon** — Will (flows from pleasure)
3. **Sekhel** — Intellect (implements the will)

**Key Principle**: Will without pleasure is temporary. Deep, lasting desire comes from Taanug.

### Taanug vs. Ratzon

| Taanug (Pleasure) | Ratzon (Will) |
|:------------------|:--------------|
| The *motivation* | The *direction* |
| "Why you want it" | "What you want" |
| Inner Keter | Outer Keter |
| More concealed | More revealed |

## Sources in Torah & Chassidus

### Tanya and Maamarim

The teaching that Taanug is the *root* of Ratzon:
> כי עונג הוא שורש הרצון
> *"For pleasure is the root of will."*

You cannot truly will something without finding pleasure in it.

### Oneg Shabbos

The mitzvah to take pleasure (*Oneg*) in Shabbos connects to this:
- Shabbos reveals the level of Taanug
- Physical pleasures on Shabbos draw down spiritual Taanug
- "Call Shabbos a delight" (Isaiah 58:13)

## Key Teachings

### Teaching 1: Two Levels of Pleasure

| Level | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **Taanug B'Etzem** | Essential pleasure — pleasure in the thing itself |
| **Taanug SheB'Ratzon** | Pleasure in the will — pleasure from achieving a goal |

### Teaching 2: G-d's Pleasure

G-d created the world for *pleasure*:
> נתאוה הקב"ה להיות לו דירה בתחתונים
> *"G-d desired a dwelling in the lower realms."*

This desire comes from a deeper *delight* — Taanug in having His essence revealed below.

## Practical Application

### 1. Finding True Will
To discover your true will, ask: "What brings me *pleasure*?" Surface desires often mask deeper delights.

### 2. Shabbos
Engage in Oneg Shabbos — the physical pleasures connect to spiritual Taanug.

### 3. Avodah
Serve G-d with delight, not just duty. True service flows from pleasure.
