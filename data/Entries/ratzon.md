# Ratzon (רצון) - Will / Desire

---

## Definition

**Ratzon** (Heb. רצון) means "Will" or "Desire." In Chassidus, it refers to the soul faculty that *precedes* and *transcends* intellect — the primal desire that cannot be explained or reasoned. Spiritually, Ratzon corresponds to *Keter* (Crown) and is associated with *Sovev Kol Almin* (transcendent light), as the Divine Will transcends the created worlds.

**Hebrew**: רצון  
**Root**: ר-צ-ה (Reish-Tzadi-Hei) — to want, desire, be pleased  
**Sefirah**: Associated with *Keter* (Crown)  
**Pronunciation**: rah-TZOHN

## Overview

### The Core Concept

> רצון העליון הוא בחינת סובב כל עלמין
> *"The Supernal Will is the aspect of Sovev Kol Almin."* — Tanya, Ch. 51

**Key Points:**
- Will *precedes* intellect — you want before you understand why
- The "Crown" (*Keter*) is above the "head" — transcending the mind
- Divine Ratzon = Mitzvos = G-d's Will expressed in commandments

### Will vs. Intellect

| Aspect | Ratzon (Will) | Sekhel (Intellect) |
|:-------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| **Position** | Above | Within |
| **Nature** | Primal, unexplainable | Logical, reasoned |
| **Mashal** | The crown | The head |
| **Divine Level** | Sovev (transcendent) | Memale (immanent) |

## Sources in Torah & Chassidus

### Tanya, Chapter 51

The Will is identified with Sovev:
- Will cannot be "grasped" by the created intellect
- It simply *surrounds* the mind, directing without being contained

### Mitzvos as Ratzon

The commandments express Divine Will:
> המצות הן רצון העליון
> *"The Mitzvos are the Supernal Will."*

This is why physical mitzvos (action beyond reason) connect to Sovev — they grasp the Will.

## Key Teachings

### Teaching 1: Will Transcends Reason

You cannot fully explain *why* you want something fundamental. Ultimately, you just want it. Similarly, G-d's Will for Torah and Mitzvos is beyond explanation — it is His essence expressing itself.

### Teaching 2: Ratzon and Keter

In the Sefirotic structure:
- **Keter** = Will/Desire
- It "crowns" the head — above intellect (*Chochmah/Binah*)
- The first expression of the soul before thought

### Teaching 3: Accessing Ratzon

Through *Mesiras Nefesh* (self-sacrifice), one connects to the level of Will — transcending reason to serve G-d.

## Practical Application

### 1. Mitzvos
When performing a mitzvah, recognize: you are grasping G-d's Will — beyond understanding.

### 2. Prayer
In the Amidah (standing prayer), we stand before the King — accessing the level of Ratzon.

### 3. Decision-Making
When intellect is exhausted, consult the deeper Will — what do you *really* want?
