# Emunah (אמונה) - Faith

---

## Definition

**Emunah** (Heb. אמונה) means "Faith." In Chassidus, it is not mere belief but an *innate connection* — a knowing that transcends intellect. Every Jew possesses Emunah as an inheritance (*Yerusha*) from the Avos. It is rooted in the *Yechidah* — the deepest level of the soul that is always united with G-d.

**Hebrew**: אמונה  
**Root**: א-מ-ן (Alef-Mem-Nun) — firmness, truth, faithfulness  
**Soul Level**: Yechidah  
**Pronunciation**: eh-moo-NAH

## Overview

### The Core Concept

> כל ישראל מאמינים בני מאמינים
> *"All Israel are believers, children of believers."* — Shabbos 97a

**Key Points:**
- Emunah is *inherited* — part of Jewish spiritual DNA
- It exists even when covered — the "Pintle Yid" (Jewish spark)
- It cannot be destroyed — only revealed or concealed

### Emunah vs. Understanding

| Emunah (Faith) | Haskalah (Understanding) |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| Above intellect | Within intellect |
| Cannot be shaken by logic | Can be challenged |
| Inherited | Acquired |
| Yechidah | Chochmah/Binah |

## Sources in Torah & Chassidus

### Tanya, Chapter 18

The Alter Rebbe on inherited faith:
> האמונה היא למעלה מן הדעת... והיא ירושה לנו מאבותינו
> *"Faith is above knowledge... and it is an inheritance from our forefathers."*

### The Unbreakable Bond

Even when a Jew sins or denies:
- The Emunah remains intact at the Yechidah level
- It is *covered*, not destroyed
- This is why Teshuvah (return) is always possible

## Key Teachings

### Teaching 1: Emunah is the Foundation

> צדיק באמונתו יחיה
> *"The righteous lives by his faith."* — Habakkuk 2:4

All 613 commandments rest upon this foundation. Without Emunah, nothing else stands.

### Teaching 2: The 13 Principles

Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith articulate intellectual beliefs, but the *koach* (power) to believe them is Emunah — prior to the specifics.

### Teaching 3: Revealed and Concealed

Chassidus teaches that our task is to *reveal* the Emunah already present:
- Through Hisbonenus (contemplation)
- Through Torah study
- Through Mitzvos

## Practical Application

### 1. In Difficulty
When facing challenges, access your Emunah — the inherited certainty that G-d is with you.

### 2. In Doubt
Intellectual doubts cannot uproot Emunah. They are "external noise" — return to your core.

### 3. Avodas Hashem
Begin each prayer with *Modeh Ani* — an expression of pure faith before any intellectual content.
