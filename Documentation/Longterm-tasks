# Chabad Mafteach Frontend Roadmap

## Current Status
- ✅ Topics pages simplified to use minimal Directus fields (canonical_title, topic_type, description).
- ✅ **TypeScript schema aligned with new Directus data model** (Dec 8, 2025).
- ✅ Tanya reader now fetches from Directus (paragraphs/statements) instead of hardcoded data.
- ✅ Search API stabilized with error handling for permissions.
- ✅ Mobile search modal layout improved.
- ✅ Legacy type aliases added for backward compatibility (Sefer→Document, Location→Paragraph, etc.).
- ✅ **Premium BookReader component created** - transforms seforim page into professional reading experience (Dec 8, 2025).
- ✅ **Seforim UX issues resolved** - fixed z-index, mobile popup, click-to-close functionality (Dec 8, 2025).
- ⏳ **Next: Pick one track below and execute.**

## Schema Migration Notes (Dec 8, 2025)
The frontend TypeScript types now match the new Directus schema:
- **Collections**: `documents`, `paragraphs`, `statements`, `topics`, `statement_topics`, `sources`, `source_links`, `translations`
- **Removed**: `seforim`, `locations`, `texts`, `topic_citations` (replaced with new collections)
- **See**: `Documentation/New-directus-data-model.md` for complete schema reference

---

## TRACK 1: Topics Detail Page (Unblock everything else)

**Goal**: Make `/topics/[slug]` simple, fast, and honest about what data exists.

### Phase 1a: MVP Detail Page (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Simplify `TopicHeader` to show only: title (canonical_title), category (topic_type), short description.
- [ ] Remove or feature-flag `BoundariesTab`, `SourcesTab`, `RelatedTab` from `TopicTabs` (mark as "Coming soon").
- [ ] Remove `TopicSidebar` from detail page layout.
- [ ] Test: `/topics/[slug]` loads fast, renders cleanly on desktop + mobile, never shows broken/empty sections.

### Phase 1b: Rich Content Fields (After Phase 1a)
- [ ] Add to Directus `topics`: `overview`, `article`, `practical_takeaways`, `historical_context` (rich text fields).
- [ ] Wire `TopicOverview` to render these fields when present.
- [ ] Update `TopicTabs` to conditionally show tabs only if content exists.

### Phase 1c: Boundaries & Relationships (After Phase 1b)
- [ ] Add to Directus `topics`: `definition_positive`, `definition_negative` (rich text).
- [ ] Wire `BoundariesTab` to render these.
- [ ] Implement `topic_relationships` query and wire `RelatedTab` + `TopicSidebar`.

### Phase 1d: Citations & Sources (After Phase 1c)
- [ ] Redesign `SourcesTab` to query `statements` tagged with topic (via `statement_topics`), group by source.
- [ ] Ensure Directus permissions allow static token to read `statements`, `sources`, `source_links`.

---

## TRACK 2: Search (Topics-first, then Seforim)

**Goal**: Make search feel responsive and reliable for topics, then extend to seforim.

### Phase 2a: Topics Search Feel (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Audit `/api/search` topics filter: decide whether to fetch broader set + rely on Fuse, or expand server-side filter to include `slug` + future translation fields.
- [ ] Test: typing a topic's English name reliably returns that topic (no vanishing as you add letters).
- [ ] Update `CommandMenu` to show topic results with clear category/type badge.

### Phase 2b: Seforim Search (After 2a)
- [ ] Finalize where seforim live: `documents` (current) or dedicated `seforim` collection.
- [ ] Ensure `/api/search` queries the right collection and handles permissions gracefully.
- [ ] Test: searching "Tanya" or other sefer titles returns results in Sources section.

### Phase 2c: Mobile Search UX (After 2b)
- [ ] Convert `CommandMenu` on small screens to a true **bottom sheet** (full-height, swipe-down to close).
- [ ] Add larger touch targets and clearer result type differentiation.
- [ ] Test on real mobile device: open, search, select, close all feel smooth.

## TRACK 3: TorahReader (Tanya → Generic)

**Goal**: Generalize the Tanya prototype into a reusable reader for any sefer.

### Phase 3a: Extract & Generalize (IMMEDIATE)
- [x] ~~Rename `TanyaChapterReader` → `TorahReader`.~~ **BETTER**: Created `BookReader` component with premium UX.
- [x] Extract Tanya-specific data into a clean `Chapter` / `Block` interface (matches `documents/paragraphs/statements` shape).
- [x] ~~Keep reading from local `likkutei-amarim-1.ts` for now~~ **DONE**: Now fetches from Directus.
- [x] Test: `/seforim/tanya-likkutei-amarim/1` still works, reader is reusable.

### Phase 3b: Directus Modeling (After 3a)
- [x] Model `documents` (seforim) → `paragraphs` (chapters/sections) → `statements` (lines/blocks) in Directus. **DONE**
- [ ] Add `translations` collection entries for Hebrew/English pairs.
- [x] Wire `[perek]/page.tsx` to fetch from Directus instead of local file. **DONE** (Dec 8, 2025)

### Phase 3c: Commentary & Translation UI (After 3b)
- [ ] Design UI for showing Hebrew + English together (toggle or side-by-side).
- [ ] Add support for inline commentary blocks (type: 'commentary' in statements).
- [x] ~~Test: reader shows Hebrew, user can toggle to English, commentary appears inline or in sidebar.~~ **PARTIAL**: Reader shows Hebrew beautifully with premium UX, translation toggle not yet implemented.

---

## TRACK 5: Content Editor (Lower priority, after core tracks)

**Goal**: Build a WYSIWYG editor for content creators to easily edit topics and books, aligned with the current Directus model. Behind authentication with Editor role.

### Phase 5a: MVP Editor Forms (After Phase 1b)
- [ ] Build simple authenticated forms for Topics: title, slug, topic_type, description, metadata.
- [ ] Build simple authenticated forms for Documents: title, doc_type, metadata.
- [ ] Gate behind Editor role (use existing Directus auth or Next.js auth).
- [ ] Save directly to Directus via API with proper permissions.
- [ ] Test: Content team can create/edit topics and documents without touching Directus UI.

### Phase 5b: Rich Text & Order Management (After Phase 5a)
- [ ] Add rich-text WYSIWYG for `description` and metadata fields (Markdown/HTML support).
- [ ] Build Paragraphs editor with order-key generation (auto-increment LexoRank).
- [ ] Build Statements editor with inline topic tagging interface.
- [ ] Add bulk import/export for JSON files (aligned with DATA_INGESTION_SPEC_v2).
- [ ] Test: Editors can structure a full sefer hierarchy and tag statements.

### Phase 5c: Translation & Review UI (After Phase 5b)
- [ ] Add side-by-side translation interface for statements/paragraphs.
- [ ] Build review workflow for translation quality levels.
- [ ] Add preview mode to see how content renders in frontend.
- [ ] Test: Translators can work efficiently and preview changes.

---

## TRACK 6: Editor Refactor (Phase 2 - COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Clean up the codebase now that citation feature is working.

### Phase 2.1: Extract Citation Plugin (COMPLETED)
- [x] Move citation logic from `ProseEditor.tsx` into a self-contained ProseMirror plugin in `components/editor/plugins/citations/`
- [x] Include: cmdk palette, suggestion trigger, node insertion logic
- [x] Update ProseEditor to use the new comprehensive citation plugin
- [x] Test: Citation workflow still works after extraction

### Phase 2.2: Extract `useEditor` Hook (COMPLETED)
- [x] Review current `useEditor` hook implementation
- [x] Consolidate any remaining data-fetching, state management, and save logic from `app/editor/page.tsx`
- [x] Ensure page component is clean and isolated editor logic

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES (URGENT - BLOCKING EDITOR)

### **Directus Permissions Configuration (REQUIRED)**
**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE - BLOCKING EDITOR FUNCTIONALITY
**Impact:** Editor completely broken - 403 Forbidden on all API calls
**Action Required:**
- Login to Directus Admin: https://directus-production-20db.up.railway.app/admin
- Go to Settings → Access Control
- Create/configure "Public" role with READ permissions for:
  - documents collection (all fields)
  - topics collection (all fields) 
  - sources collection (all fields)
  - authors collection (all fields)
- Assign static token `Y2uEb9-2oyj8-DEn5eeJypUw7xUGuR96` to Public role
- Test: Editor should load StructureSidebar and citations without 403 errors

**Next Agent:** Check if this has been resolved before proceeding with any editor work!

---

---

## TRACK 4: Infrastructure & Testing (Lower priority, do in parallel)

- [ ] Decide final Directus public-access model: which collections/fields readable by static token.
- [ ] Implement + test permission changes in staging before production.
- [ ] Add integration tests for topics, search, and TorahReader to catch regressions.
- [x] Document the new topics data model and frontend mapping in repo docs. **DONE** (See `lib/types/index.ts` and `Documentation/New-directus-data-model.md`)
- [ ] Re-enable term-linking pipeline (`linkTerms`) once topics schema is stable (Phase 1c).
- [x] Align TypeScript types with new Directus schema. **DONE** (Dec 8, 2025)

---

## Component Cleanup Tasks (Added Dec 8, 2025)

**Priority**: High - Remove unused code to improve maintainability

1. **[HIGH] Remove 3 unused components** - Immediate cleanup to reduce bundle size:
   - `button` (UI component) - **REMOVED**
   - `TanyaChapterReader` - **REMOVED** 
   - `TopicOverview` - **REMOVED**

2. **[HIGH] Complete TopicTabs implementation** - Currently only renders OverviewTab, needs full tab functionality

3. **[MEDIUM] Reconfigure topic components for new DB schema** - Future implementation:
   - `TopicArticle` - Connect to Document + paragraph/statement system
   - `RelatedTab` - Link to existing related topics in DB
   - `SourcesTab` - Reconfigure for new Directus schema
   - `TopicSidebar` - Shelve for future use

4. **[MEDIUM] Review and split large components** - Consider breaking down:
   - `BookReader` (346 lines) - consider lazy loading
   - `CommandMenu` (302 lines) - extract business logic
   - `SourcesTab` (231 lines) - if re-used
   - `OverviewTab` (208 lines) - if re-used

5. **[MEDIUM] Add component documentation** - Document complex features and interfaces

6. **[LOW] Extract business logic from UI components** - Separate concerns where appropriate

7. **[LOW] Implement lazy loading for large components** - Optimize bundle size and loading performance

---

## Remaining Roadmap Items from Editor Audit:
- Implement full Phase 2 refactor, including consolidating all editor state management into hooks and extracting plugins.
- Add contextual editing for citations, such as making citation chips clickable for quick edits.
- Develop collaboration features using Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDTs for real-time editing.
- Enhance author disambiguation UI for better user prompts and error handling.

---

## Execution Order (Recommended)

1. **Start with TRACK 1, Phase 1a** (Topics MVP): unblocks everything else, takes ~1–2 days.
2. **Then Component Cleanup Task #1** (Remove unused components): immediate code quality improvement, ~0.5 day.
3. **Then TRACK 2, Phase 2a** (Topics search): makes the app feel responsive, ~1 day.
4. **Then Component Cleanup Task #2** (Complete TopicTabs): unblock topic functionality, ~0.5 day.
5. **Then TRACK 3, Phase 3a** (TorahReader extraction): sets up for real Directus data, ~1 day.
6. **Then TRACK 1, Phase 1b** (Rich content fields): expands topics, ~2–3 days.
7. **Parallel**: Remaining component cleanup tasks (#3-6) and TRACK 4 (infrastructure) as needed.

---

## Notes for the Team

- **Each phase is a complete, shippable unit.** Don't move to the next phase until the current one is tested and working.
- **Directus schema changes** (adding fields, permissions) should be done in staging first, tested, then promoted to production.
- **Mobile testing is critical** for Phases 1a, 2c, 3a. Use real devices or DevTools emulation.
- **Ask questions early** if a phase's scope is unclear or blocked by missing Directus data.

---

## TRACK 7: Security & Reliability (Added from Security Audit)

**Goal**: Secure the application against unauthorized access and ensure stability under load.

### Phase 7a: Authentication & Authorization (High Priority)
- [ ] **Implement Auth Layer**: Integrate NextAuth.js or Directus Auth for API routes.
- [ ] **Secure API Routes**: Protect /api/ingest/* and /api/statements/break against unauthenticated access.
- [ ] **Token Management**: Ensure no write-access tokens are ever exposed to the client (process check).

### Phase 7b: Operational Stability
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for ingestion and AI endpoints to prevent DoS.
- [ ] **Testing Framework**: Set up Jest/Vitest for unit testing utility functions (e.g., AI logic).
- [ ] **Sanitization**: Ensure strict input validation for all API endpoints.

---

## TRACK 8: Innovation & Features (Future Vision)

**Goal**: Transform the platform into a dynamic, collaborative scholar tool.

### Phase 8a: Advanced Editor Features
- [ ] **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time multi-user editing using ProseMirror + WebSockets.
- [ ] **AI Citation Verification**: Verify detected citations against external APIs (Sefaria, HebrewBooks).

### Phase 8b: Visualization & Discovery
- [ ] **Interactive Graph**: Visualize topic connections using react-force-graph-2d.
- [ ] **Source-First View**: Browse entire works (e.g. Tanya) with overlay annotations.
- [ ] **Personalized Learning**: Recommendation engine based on user reading history.

### Phase 8c: Engagement & Access
- [ ] **Gamification**: Leaderboards for contributors (verifying links, tagging).
- [ ] **Offline Mode**: PWA support for downloading topics/books for offline reading.
- [ ] **Multilingual Sync**: Synced scrolling associated Hebrew/English paragraphs.
